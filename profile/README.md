## Welcome to Tether.js

This framework is still a work in progress, so please keep in mind that things might break and get fixed fast. Also, our APIs might change as well as the underlying code, so if you are relying on hacky methods to implement functionalities, those might not work for long. This is due to our use of [Necto](https://github.com/nectoutil), which drives most of our complex implementations.

Thanks and happy hacking ;)
